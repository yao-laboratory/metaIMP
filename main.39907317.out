this is reference based mapping
finished adding fig_ids to peg_ids. now run patric.sh first to get the annotation. then last step is to map the annotation with midas by running the ref_map command
we are now processing all genes files to which fig_id tag is added and these files will now run through PATRIC DATABASE
currently processing/work/yaolab/shared/2021_milk_2017_metagenome/MIT_DATA/sample_SRR9205537/reference_output/genes/*.patric.csv
completed mapping PEG_IDs to PATRIC
completed reference_mapping. Good luck!!!
Finished annotations and mapping snps. Reference pipeline is now complete. Thank you!!!
